Detroit Timber &amp; Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n                  GLOSSIP ET AL. v. GROSS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 14–7955. Argued April 29, 2015—Decided June 29, 2015\nBecause capital punishment is constitutional, there must be a constitu-\n  tional means of carrying it out. After Oklahoma adopted lethal injec-\n  tion as its method of execution, it settled on a three-drug protocol of\n  (1) sodium thiopental (a barbiturate) to induce a state of uncon-\n  sciousness, (2) a paralytic agent to inhibit all muscular-skeletal\n  movements, and (3) potassium chloride to induce cardiac arrest. In\n  Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, the Court held that this protocol does not\n  violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unu-\n  sual punishments. Anti-death-penalty advocates then pressured\n  pharmaceutical companies to prevent sodium thiopental (and, later,\n  another barbiturate called pentobarbital) from being used in execu-\n  tions. Unable to obtain either sodium thiopental or pentobarbital,\n  Oklahoma decided to use a 500-milligram dose of midazolam, a seda-\n  tive, as the first drug in its three-drug protocol.\n     Oklahoma death-row inmates filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 action\n  claiming that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment.\n  Four of those inmates filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and\n  argued that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will not render them\n  unable to feel pain associated with administration of the second and\n  third drugs. After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the District Court\n  denied the motion. It held that the prisoners failed to identify a\n  known and available alternative method of execution that presented\n  a substantially less severe risk of pain. It also held that the prison-\n  ers failed to establish a likelihood of showing that the use of midazo-\n  lam created a demonstrated risk of severe pain. The Tenth Circuit\n  affirmed.\nHeld: Petitioners have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the\n merits of their claim that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth\n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
  [2] "2                           GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Amendment. Pp. 11–29.\n       (a) To obtain a preliminary injunction, petitioners must establish,\n    among other things, a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n    claim. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555\n    U. S. 7, 20. To succeed on an Eighth Amendment method-of-\n    execution claim, a prisoner must establish that the method creates a\n    demonstrated risk of severe pain and that the risk is substantial\n    when compared to the known and available alternatives. Baze, su-\n    pra, at 61 (plurality opinion). Pp. 11–13.\n       (b) Petitioners failed to establish that any risk of harm was sub-\n    stantial when compared to a known and available alternative method\n    of execution. Petitioners have suggested that Oklahoma could exe-\n    cute them using sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, but the District\n    Court did not commit a clear error when it found that those drugs are\n    unavailable to the State. Petitioners argue that the Eighth Amend-\n    ment does not require them to identify such an alternative, but their\n    argument is inconsistent with the controlling opinion in Baze, which\n    imposed a requirement that the Court now follows. Petitioners also\n    argue that the requirement to identify an alternative is inconsistent\n    with the Court’s pre-Baze decision in Hill v. McDonough, 547 U. S.\n    573, but they misread that decision. Hill concerned a question of civ-\n    il procedure, not a substantive Eighth Amendment question. That\n    case held that §1983 alone does not require an inmate asserting a\n    method-of-execution claim to plead an acceptable alternative. Baze,\n    on the other hand, made clear that the Eighth Amendment requires a\n    prisoner to plead and prove a known and available alternative.\n    Pp. 13–16.\n       (c) The District Court did not commit clear error when it found that\n    midazolam is likely to render a person unable to feel pain associated\n    with administration of the paralytic agent and potassium chloride.\n    Pp. 16–29.\n          (1) Several initial considerations bear emphasis. First, the Dis-\n    trict Court’s factual findings are reviewed under the deferential\n    “clear error” standard. Second, petitioners have the burden of per-\n    suasion on the question whether midazolam is effective. Third, the\n    fact that numerous courts have concluded that midazolam is likely to\n    render an inmate insensate to pain during execution heightens the\n    deference owed to the District Court’s findings. Finally, challenges to\n    lethal injection protocols test the boundaries of the authority and\n    competency of federal courts, which should not embroil themselves in\n    ongoing scientific controversies beyond their expertise. Baze, supra,\n    at 51. Pp. 16–18.\n          (2) The State’s expert presented persuasive testimony that a 500-\n    milligram dose of midazolam would make it a virtual certainty that\n"
  [3] "                     Cite as: 576 U. S. ____ (2015)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  an inmate will not feel pain associated with the second and third\n  drugs, and petitioners’ experts acknowledged that they had no con-\n  trary scientific proof. Expert testimony presented by both sides lends\n  support to the District Court’s conclusion. Evidence suggested that a\n  500-milligram dose of midazolam will induce a coma, and even one of\n  petitioners’ experts agreed that as the dose of midazolam increases, it\n  is expected to produce a lack of response to pain. It is not dispositive\n  that midazolam is not recommended or approved for use as the sole\n  anesthetic during painful surgery. First, the 500-milligram dose at\n  issue here is many times higher than a normal therapeutic dose.\n  Second, the fact that a low dose of midazolam is not the best drug for\n  maintaining unconsciousness says little about whether a 500-\n  milligram dose is constitutionally adequate to conduct an execution.\n  Finally, the District Court did not err in concluding that the safe-\n  guards adopted by Oklahoma to ensure proper administration of\n  midazolam serve to minimize any risk that the drug will not operate\n  as intended. Pp. 18–22.\n       (3) Petitioners’ speculative evidence regarding midazolam’s “ceil-\n  ing effect” does not establish that the District Court’s findings were\n  clearly erroneous. The mere fact that midazolam has a ceiling above\n  which an increase in dosage produces no effect cannot be dispositive,\n  and petitioners provided little probative evidence on the relevant\n  question, i.e., whether midazolam’s ceiling effect occurs below the\n  level of a 500-milligram dose and at a point at which the drug does\n  not have the effect of rendering a person insensate to pain caused by\n  the second and third drugs. Petitioners attempt to deflect attention\n  from their failure of proof on this point by criticizing the testimony of\n  the State’s expert. They emphasize an apparent conflict between the\n  State’s expert and their own expert regarding the biological process\n  that produces midazolam’s ceiling effect. But even if petitioners’ ex-\n  pert is correct regarding that biological process, it is largely beside\n  the point. What matters for present purposes is the dosage at which\n  the ceiling effect kicks in, not the biological process that produces the\n  effect. Pp. 22–25.\n       (4) Petitioners’ remaining arguments—that an expert report pre-\n  sented in the District Court should have been rejected because it ref-\n  erenced unreliable sources and contained an alleged mathematical\n  error, that only four States have used midazolam in an execution,\n  and that difficulties during two recent executions suggest that mid-\n  azolam is ineffective—all lack merit.

Stat. §1979, 42\nU. S. C. §1983, contending that the method of execution\nnow used by the State violates the Eighth Amendment\nbecause it creates an unacceptable risk of severe pain.\nThey argue that midazolam, the first drug employed in the\nState’s current three-drug protocol, fails to render a per-\nson insensate to pain. After holding an evidentiary hear-\ning, the District Court denied four prisoners’ application\nfor a preliminary injunction, finding that they had failed\nto prove that midazolam is ineffective. The Court of Ap-\npeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed and accepted the\nDistrict Court’s finding of fact regarding midazolam’s\nefficacy.\n   For two independent reasons, we also affirm. First, the\nprisoners failed to identify a known and available alterna-\ntive method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain,\na requirement of all Eighth Amendment method-of-\nexecution claims.

In that era, death sentences were usually carried\nout by hanging. The Death Penalty in America: Current\nControversies 4 (H. Bedau ed. 1997). Hanging remained\nthe standard method of execution through much of the\n19th century, but that began to change in the century’s\nlater years. See Baze, supra, at 41–42. In the 1880’s, the\nLegislature of the State of New York appointed a commis-\nsion to find “ ‘the most humane and practical method\nknown to modern science of carrying into effect the sen-\ntence of death in capital cases.’ ” In re Kemmler, 136 U. S.\n436, 444 (1890). The commission recommended electrocu-\ntion, and in 1888, the Legislature enacted a law providing\nfor this method of execution. Id., at 444–445. In subse-\nquent years, other States followed New York’s lead in the\n“ ‘belief that electrocution is less painful and more humane\nthan hanging.’ ” Baze, 553 U. S., at 42 (quoting Malloy v.\nSouth Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 185 (1915)).\n    In 1921, the Nevada Legislature adopted another new\nmethod of execution, lethal gas, after concluding that this\nwas “the most humane manner known to modern science.”\nState v. Jon, 46 Nev. 418, 437, 211 P. 676, 682 (1923). The\nNevada Supreme Court rejected the argument that the\nuse of lethal gas was unconstitutional, id., at 435–437, 211\nP., at 681–682, and other States followed Nevada’s lead,\nsee, e.g., Ariz. Const., Art. XXII, §22 (1933); 1937 Cal.\nStats. ch. 172, §1; 1933 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 61, §1; 1955\nMd. Laws ch. 625, §1, p. 1017; 1937 Mo.

Laws ch. 309, §2 (hang-\ning); 1935 Kan. Sess. Laws ch. 155, §1 (hanging); Utah\nCode Crim. Proc. §105–37–16 (1933) (hanging or firing\nsquad), and electrocution remained the predominant\nmethod of execution until the 9-year hiatus in executions\nthat ended with our judgment in Gregg v. Georgia, 428\nU. S. 153 (1976). See Baze, supra, at 42.\n  After Gregg reaffirmed that the death penalty does not\nviolate the Constitution, some States once again sought a\nmore humane way to carry out death sentences. They\neventually adopted lethal injection, which today is “by far\nthe most prevalent method of execution in the United\nStates.” Baze, supra, at 42. Oklahoma adopted lethal\ninjection in 1977, see 1977 Okla. Sess. Laws p. 89, and it\neventually settled on a protocol that called for the use of\nthree drugs: (1) sodium thiopental, “a fast-acting barbitu-\nrate sedative that induces a deep, comalike unconscious-\nness when given in the amounts used for lethal injection,”\n(2) a paralytic agent, which “inhibits all muscular-skeletal\nmovements and, by paralyzing the diaphragm, stops respi-\nration,” and (3) potassium chloride, which “interferes with\nthe electrical signals that stimulate the contractions of the\nheart, inducing cardiac arrest.” Baze, supra, at 44; see\nalso Brief for Respondents 9. By 2008, at least 30 of the\n36 States that used lethal injection employed that particu-\nlar three-drug protocol. 553 U. S., at 44.\n  While methods of execution have changed over the\nyears, “[t]his Court has never invalidated a State’s chosen\nprocedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the\ninfliction of cruel and unusual punishment.” Id., at 48. In\nWilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 134–135 (1879), the Court\nupheld a sentence of death by firing squad. In In re\nKemmler, supra, at 447–449, the Court rejected a chal-\nlenge to the use of the electric chair.

Most recently, in Baze, supra, seven Jus-\ntices agreed that the three-drug protocol just discussed\ndoes not violate the Eighth Amendment.\n   Our decisions in this area have been animated in part\nby the recognition that because it is settled that capital\npunishment is constitutional, “[i]t necessarily follows that\nthere must be a [constitutional] means of carrying it out.”\nId., at 47. And because some risk of pain is inherent in\nany method of execution, we have held that the Constitu-\ntion does not require the avoidance of all risk of pain.\nIbid. After all, while most humans wish to die a painless\ndeath, many do not have that good fortune. Holding that\nthe Eighth Amendment demands the elimination of essen-\ntially all risk of pain would effectively outlaw the death\npenalty altogether.\n                               B\n   Baze cleared any legal obstacle to use of the most com-\nmon three-drug protocol that had enabled States to carry\nout the death penalty in a quick and painless fashion. But\na practical obstacle soon emerged, as anti-death-penalty\nadvocates pressured pharmaceutical companies to refuse\nto supply the drugs used to carry out death sentences.\nThe sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental, the\nfirst drug used in the standard three-drug protocol, was\npersuaded to cease production of the drug. After suspend-\ning domestic production in 2009, the company planned to\nresume production in Italy. Koppel, Execution Drug Halt\nRaises Ire of Doctors, Wall Street Journal, Jan. 25, 2011,\np. A6. Activists then pressured both the company and the\nItalian Government to stop the sale of sodium thiopental\nfor use in lethal injections in this country.

That effort proved success-\nful, and in January 2011, the company announced that it\nwould exit the sodium thiopental market entirely. See\nHospira, Press Release, Hospira Statement Regarding\nPentothalTM (sodium thiopental) Market Exit (Jan. 21,\n2011).\n   After other efforts to procure sodium thiopental proved\nunsuccessful, States sought an alternative, and they even-\ntually replaced sodium thiopental with pentobarbital,\nanother barbiturate. In December 2010, Oklahoma be-\ncame the first State to execute an inmate using pentobar-\nbital. See Reuters, Chicago Tribune, New Drug Mix Used\nin Oklahoma Execution, Dec. 17 2010, p. 41. That execu-\ntion occurred without incident, and States gradually shifted\nto pentobarbital as their supplies of sodium thiopental\nran out. It is reported that pentobarbital was used in all\nof the 43 executions carried out in 2012.

That manufacturer opposed\nthe death penalty and took steps to block the shipment of\npentobarbital for use in executions in the United States.\nStein, New Obstacle to Death Penalty in U. S., Washing-\nton Post, July 3, 2011, p. A4. Oklahoma eventually be-\ncame unable to acquire the drug through any means. The\nDistrict Court below found that both sodium thiopental\nand pentobarbital are now unavailable to Oklahoma. App.\n67–68.\n                             C\n  Unable to acquire either sodium thiopental or pentobar-\nbital, some States have turned to midazolam, a sedative in\nthe benzodiazepine family of drugs. In October 2013,\nFlorida became the first State to substitute midazolam for\npentobarbital as part of a three-drug lethal injection pro-\ntocol. Fernandez, Executions Stall As States Seek Differ-\nent Drugs, N. Y. Times, Nov. 9, 2013, p. A1. To date,\nFlorida has conducted 11 executions using that protocol,\nwhich calls for midazolam followed by a paralytic agent\nand potassium chloride. See Brief for State of Florida as\nAmicus Curiae 2–3; Chavez v. Florida SP Warden, 742\nF. 3d 1267, 1269 (CA11 2014). In 2014, Oklahoma also\nsubstituted midazolam for pentobarbital as part of its\nthree-drug protocol. Oklahoma has already used this\nthree-drug protocol twice: to execute Clayton Lockett in\nApril 2014 and Charles Warner in January 2015. (Warner\nwas one of the four inmates who moved for a preliminary\ninjunction in this case.)\n  The Lockett execution caused Oklahoma to implement\nnew safety precautions as part of its lethal injection proto-\ncol. When Oklahoma executed Lockett, its protocol called\nfor the administration of 100 milligrams of midazolam, as\ncompared to the 500 milligrams that are currently re-\nquired. On the morning of his execution, Lockett cut\nhimself twice at “ ‘the bend of the elbow.’ ” App. 50.

The team eventually\nbelieved that it had established intravenous access\nthrough Lockett’s right femoral vein, and it covered the\ninjection access point with a sheet, in part to preserve\nLockett’s dignity during the execution. After the team\nadministered the midazolam and a physician determined\nthat Lockett was unconscious, the team next administered\nthe paralytic agent (vecuronium bromide) and most of the\npotassium chloride. Lockett began to move and speak, at\nwhich point the physician lifted the sheet and determined\nthat the IV had “infiltrated,” which means that “the IV\nfluid, rather than entering Lockett’s blood stream, had\nleaked into the tissue surrounding the IV access point.”\nWarner v. Gross, 776 F. 3d 721, 725 (CA10 2015) (case\nbelow). The execution team stopped administering the\nremaining potassium chloride and terminated the execu-\ntion about 33 minutes after the midazolam was first in-\njected. About 10 minutes later, Lockett was pronounced\ndead.\n   An investigation into the Lockett execution concluded\nthat “the viability of the IV access point was the single\ngreatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in admin-\nistering the execution drugs.” App. 398. The investiga-\ntion, which took five months to complete, recommended\nseveral changes to Oklahoma’s execution protocol, and\nOklahoma adopted a new protocol with an effective date of\nSeptember 30, 2014. That protocol allows the Oklahoma\nDepartment of Corrections to choose among four different\ndrug combinations. The option that Oklahoma plans to\nuse to execute petitioners calls for the administration of\n500 milligrams of midazolam followed by a paralytic agent\n"

The protocol also\nincludes procedural safeguards to help ensure that an\ninmate remains insensate to any pain caused by the ad-\nministration of the paralytic agent and potassium chlo-\nride. Those safeguards include: (1) the insertion of both a\nprimary and backup IV catheter, (2) procedures to confirm\nthe viability of the IV site, (3) the option to postpone an\nexecution if viable IV sites cannot be established within an\nhour, (4) a mandatory pause between administration of\nthe first and second drugs, (5) numerous procedures for\nmonitoring the offender’s consciousness, including the use\nof an electrocardiograph and direct observation, and\n(6) detailed provisions with respect to the training and\npreparation of the execution team.

The District Court first rejected petitioners’\nchallenge under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,\nInc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993), to the testimony of Dr. Evans.\nIt concluded that Dr. Evans, the Dean of Auburn Universi-\nty’s School of Pharmacy, was well qualified to testify about\nmidazolam’s properties and that he offered reliable testi-\nmony. The District Court then held that petitioners failed\nto establish a likelihood of success on the merits of their\nclaim that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth\nAmendment. The court provided two independent reasons\nfor this conclusion. First, the court held that petitioners\nfailed to identify a known and available method of execu-\ntion that presented a substantially less severe risk of pain\nthan the method that the State proposed to use. Second,\nthe court found that petitioners failed to prove that Okla-\nhoma’s protocol “presents a risk that is ‘sure or very likely\nto cause serious illness and needless suffering,’ amounting\nto ‘an objectively intolerable risk of harm.’ ” App. 96 (quot-\ning Baze, 553 U. S., at 50). The court emphasized that the\nOklahoma protocol featured numerous safeguards, includ-\ning the establishment of two IV access sites, confirmation\nof the viability of those sites, and monitoring of the offend-\ner’s level of consciousness throughout the procedure.\n   The District Court supported its decision with findings\nof fact about midazolam. It found that a 500-milligram\ndose of midazolam “would make it a virtual certainty that\nany individual will be at a sufficient level of unconscious-\nness to resist the noxious stimuli which could occur from\nthe application of the second and third drugs.” App. 77.\nIndeed, it found that a 500-milligram dose alone would\nlikely cause death by respiratory arrest within 30 minutes\n"

 [16] "12                   GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the inflic-\ntion of “cruel and unusual punishments.” The controlling\nopinion in Baze outlined what a prisoner must establish to\nsucceed on an Eighth Amendment method-of-execution\nclaim. Baze involved a challenge by Kentucky death row\ninmates to that State’s three-drug lethal injection protocol\nof sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium\nchloride. The inmates conceded that the protocol, if\nproperly administered, would result in a humane and\nconstitutional execution because sodium thiopental would\nrender an inmate oblivious to any pain caused by the\nsecond and third drugs. 553 U. S., at 49. But they argued\nthat there was an unacceptable risk that sodium thiopen-\ntal would not be properly administered. Ibid. The in-\nmates also maintained that a significant risk of harm\ncould be eliminated if Kentucky adopted a one-drug proto-\ncol and additional monitoring by trained personnel. Id., at\n51.\n   The controlling opinion in Baze first concluded that\nprisoners cannot successfully challenge a method of execu-\ntion unless they establish that the method presents a risk\nthat is “ ‘sure or very likely to cause serious illness and\nneedless suffering,’ and give rise to ‘sufficiently imminent\ndangers.’ ” Id., at 50 (quoting Helling v. McKinney, 509\nU. S. 25, 33, 34–35 (1993)). To prevail on such a claim,\n“there must be a ‘substantial risk of serious harm,’ an\n‘objectively intolerable risk of harm’ that prevents prison\nofficials from pleading that they were ‘subjectively blame-\nless for purposes of the Eighth Amendment.’ ” 553 U. S.,\nat 50 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 846, and\nn. 9 (1994)). The controlling opinion also stated that\nprisoners “cannot successfully challenge a State’s method\nof execution merely by showing a slightly or marginally\nsafer alternative.” 553 U. S., at 51. Instead, prisoners\nmust identify an alternative that is “feasible, readily\n"

The\npreliminary injunction posture of the present case thus\nrequires petitioners to establish a likelihood that they can\nestablish both that Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol\ncreates a demonstrated risk of severe pain and that the\nrisk is substantial when compared to the known and\navailable alternatives.\n   The challenge in Baze failed both because the Kentucky\ninmates did not show that the risks they identified were\nsubstantial and imminent, id., at 56, and because they did\nnot establish the existence of a known and available alter-\nnative method of execution that would entail a significantly\nless severe risk, id., at 57–60. Petitioners’ arguments\nhere fail for similar reasons. First, petitioners have not\nproved that any risk posed by midazolam is substantial\nwhen compared to known and available alternative meth-\nods of execution. Second, they have failed to establish that\nthe District Court committed clear error when it found\nthat the use of midazolam will not result in severe pain\nand suffering. We address each reason in turn.\n                              IV\n  Our first ground for affirmance is based on petitioners’\nfailure to satisfy their burden of establishing that any risk\nof harm was substantial when compared to a known and\navailable alternative method of execution.

They have since suggested that it might also be con-\nstitutional for Oklahoma to use pentobarbital. But the\nDistrict Court found that both sodium thiopental and\npentobarbital are now unavailable to Oklahoma’s De-\npartment of Corrections. The Court of Appeals affirmed\nthat finding, and it is not clearly erroneous. On the con-\ntrary, the record shows that Oklahoma has been unable to\nprocure those drugs despite a good-faith effort to do so.\n  Petitioners do not seriously contest this factual finding,\nand they have not identified any available drug or drugs\nthat could be used in place of those that Oklahoma is now\nunable to obtain. Nor have they shown a risk of pain so\ngreat that other acceptable, available methods must be\nused. Instead, they argue that they need not identify a\nknown and available method of execution that presents\nless risk. But this argument is inconsistent with the\ncontrolling opinion in Baze, 553 U. S., at 61, which im-\nposed a requirement that the Court now follows.2\n  Petitioners contend that the requirement to identify an\nalternative method of execution contravenes our pre-Baze\ndecision in Hill v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 573 (2006), but\nthey misread that decision.

In Baze, the opinion of\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE was joined by two other JUSTICES. JUSTICES SCALIA\nand THOMAS took the broader position that a method of execution is\nconsistent with the Eighth Amendment unless it is deliberately de-\nsigned to inflict pain. 553 U. S., at 94 (THOMAS, J. concurring in judg-\nment). Thus, as explained in Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188,\n193 (1977), THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion sets out the holding of the\ncase. It is for this reason that petitioners base their argument on the\nrule set out in that opinion.

Id.,\nat 576. We held that a method-of-execution claim must be\nbrought under §1983 because such a claim does not attack\nthe validity of the prisoner’s conviction or death sentence.\nId., at 579–580. The United States as amicus curiae\nargued that we should adopt a special pleading require-\nment to stop inmates from using §1983 actions to attack,\nnot just a particular means of execution, but the death\npenalty itself. To achieve this end, the United States\nproposed that an inmate asserting a method-of-execution\nclaim should be required to plead an acceptable alterna-\ntive method of execution. Id., at 582. We rejected that\nargument because “[s]pecific pleading requirements are\nmandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and\nnot, as a general rule, through case-by-case determina-\ntions of the federal courts.” Ibid. Hill thus held that\n§1983 alone does not impose a heightened pleading re-\nquirement. Baze, on the other hand, addressed the sub-\nstantive elements of an Eighth Amendment method-of-\nexecution claim, and it made clear that the Eighth\nAmendment requires a prisoner to plead and prove a\nknown and available alternative. Because petitioners\nfailed to do this, the District Court properly held that they\ndid not establish a likelihood of success on their Eighth\nAmendment claim.\n   Readers can judge for themselves how much distance\nthere is between the principal dissent’s argument against\nrequiring prisoners to identify an alternative and the\nview, now announced by JUSTICES BREYER and GINSBURG,\nthat the death penalty is categorically unconstitutional.\nPost, p. ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting). The principal dissent\ngoes out of its way to suggest that a State would violate\nthe Eighth Amendment if it used one of the methods of\nexecution employed before the advent of lethal injection.\n"

And the principal dissent makes this\nsuggestion even though the Court held in Wilkerson that\nthis method (the firing squad) is constitutional and even\nthough, in the words of the principal dissent, “there is\nsome reason to think that it is relatively quick and pain-\nless.” Post, at 30. Tellingly silent about the methods of\nexecution most commonly used before States switched to\nlethal injection (the electric chair and gas chamber), the\nprincipal dissent implies that it would be unconstitutional\nto use a method that “could be seen as a devolution to a\nmore primitive era.” Ibid. If States cannot return to any\nof the “more primitive” methods used in the past and if no\ndrug that meets with the principal dissent’s approval is\navailable for use in carrying out a death sentence, the\nlogical conclusion is clear. But we have time and again\nreaffirmed that capital punishment is not per se unconsti-\ntutional. See, e.g., Baze, 553 U. S., at 47; id., at 87–88\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Gregg, 428 U.

Baze, supra, at 41. Although petitioners\nexpend great effort attacking peripheral aspects of Dr.\nEvans’ testimony, they make little attempt to prove what\nis critical, i.e., that the evidence they presented to the\nDistrict Court establishes that the use of midazolam is\nsure or very likely to result in needless suffering.\n   Third, numerous courts have concluded that the use of\nmidazolam as the first drug in a three-drug protocol is\nlikely to render an inmate insensate to pain that might\nresult from administration of the paralytic agent and\npotassium chloride. See, e.g., 776 F. 3d 721 (case below\naffirming the District Court); Chavez v. Florida SP War-\nden, 742 F. 3d 1267 (affirming the District Court); Banks\nv.

Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234,\n242 (2001). Our review is even more deferential where, as\nhere, multiple trial courts have reached the same finding,\nand multiple appellate courts have affirmed those find-\nings. Cf. Exxon Co., U. S. A. v.

App. 175 (expert report of Dr. Lubarsky); id., at\n242, 244 (expert report of Dr. Sasich). The District Court found, how-\never, that the frequency with which a paradoxical reaction occurs “is\nspeculative” and that the risk “occurs with the highest frequency in low\ntherapeutic doses.” Id., at 78. Indeed, Dr. Sasich conceded that the\nincidence or risk of paradoxical reactions with midazolam “is unknown”\nand that reports estimate the risk to vary only “from 1% to above 10%.”\nId., at 244. Moreover, the mere fact that a method of execution might\nresult in some unintended side effects does not amount to an Eighth\nAmendment violation. “[T]he Constitution does not demand the avoid-\nance of all risk of pain.” Baze, 553 U.

The District Court did not commit\nclear error in concluding that these safeguards help to\nminimize any risk that might occur in the event that\nmidazolam does not operate as intended. Indeed, we\nconcluded in Baze that many of the safeguards that Okla-\nhoma employs—including the establishment of a primary\nand backup IV and the presence of personnel to monitor\nan inmate—help in significantly reducing the risk that an\nexecution protocol will violate the Eighth Amendment.\nId., at 55–56. And many other safeguards that Oklahoma\nhas adopted mirror those that the dissent in Baze com-\nplained were absent from Kentucky’s protocol in that case.\nFor example, the dissent argued that because a conscious-\nness check before injection of the second drug “can reduce\na risk of dreadful pain,” Kentucky’s failure to include that\nstep in its procedure was unconstitutional. Id., at 119\n(opinion of GINSBURG, J.). The dissent also complained\nthat Kentucky did not monitor the effectiveness of the first\ndrug or pause between injection of the first and second\ndrugs.

As\na result, they maintain, it is wrong to assume that a 500-\nmilligram dose has a much greater effect than a therapeu-\ntic dose of about 5 milligrams.

Dr. Sasich frankly admitted\nthat he did a “search to try and determine at what dose of\nmidazolam you would get a ceiling effect,” but concluded:\n“I could not find one.” Tr. 344. The closest petitioners\ncame was Dr. Lubarsky’s suggestion that the ceiling effect\noccurs “[p]robably after about . . . 40 to 50 milligrams,” but\nhe added that he had not actually done the relevant calcu-\nlations, and he admitted: “I can’t tell you right now” at\nwhat dose the ceiling effect occurs.

We cannot\nconclude that the District Court committed clear error in\ndeclining to find, based on such speculative evidence, that\nthe ceiling effect negates midazolam’s ability to render an\ninmate insensate to pain caused by the second and third\ndrugs in the protocol.\n   The principal dissent discusses the ceiling effect at\nlength, but it studiously avoids suggesting that petitioners\npresented probative evidence about the dose at which the\nceiling effect occurs or about whether the effect occurs\nbefore a person becomes insensate to pain.

But it was\npetitioners’ burden to establish that midazolam’s ceiling\noccurred at a dosage below the massive 500-milligram\ndose employed in the Oklahoma protocol and at a point at\nwhich the drug failed to render the recipient insensate to\npain. They did not meet that burden, and their criticisms\ndo not undermine Dr. Evans’ central point, which the\nDistrict Court credited, that a properly administered 500-\nmilligram dose of midazolam will render the recipient\nunable to feel pain.\n   One of petitioners’ criticisms of Dr. Evans’ testimony is\nlittle more than a quibble about the wording chosen by Dr.\nEvans at one point in his oral testimony. Petitioners’\nexpert, Dr. Lubarsky, stated in his report that midazolam\n“increases effective binding of [gamma-aminobutyric acid\n(GABA)] to its receptor to induce unconsciousness.”7 App.\n——————\n  6 The principal dissent emphasizes Dr. Lubarsky’s supposedly contra-\n\nry testimony, but the District Court was entitled to credit Dr. Evans\n(and Dr. Sasich) instead of Dr. Lubarsky on this point. And the District\nCourt had strong reasons not to credit Dr. Lubarsky, who even argued\nthat a protocol that includes sodium thiopental is “constructed to\nproduce egregious harm and suffering.” App. 227.\n  7 GABA is “an amino acid that functions as an inhibitory neuro-\n\ntransmitter in the brain and spinal cord.” Mosby’s Medical Dictionary\n"

Dr. Evans’ report provided a similar explanation of\nthe way in which midazolam works, see id., at 293–294,\nand Dr. Lubarsky did not dispute the accuracy of that\nexplanation when he testified at the hearing. Petitioners\ncontend, however, that Dr. Evans erred when he said at\nthe hearing that “[m]idazolam attaches to GABA recep-\ntors, inhibiting GABA.” Id., at 312 (emphasis added).\nPetitioners contend that this statement was incorrect\nbecause “far from inhibiting GABA, midazolam facilitates\nits binding to GABA receptors.” Brief for Petitioners 38.\n   In making this argument, petitioners are simply quar-\nrelling with the words that Dr. Evans used during oral\ntestimony in an effort to explain how midazolam works in\nterms understandable to a layman. Petitioners do not\nsuggest that the discussion of midazolam in Dr. Evans’\nexpert report was inaccurate, and as for Dr. Evans’ pass-\ning use of the term “inhibiting,” Dr. Lubarksy’s own expert\nreport states that GABA’s “inhibition of brain activity is\naccentuated by midazolam.” App. 232 (emphasis added).\nDr. Evans’ oral use of the word “inhibiting”—particularly\nin light of his written testimony—does not invalidate the\nDistrict Court’s decision to rely on his testimony.\n   Petitioners also point to an apparent conflict between\nDr. Evans’ testimony and a declaration by Dr. Lubarsky\n(submitted after the District Court ruled) regarding the\nbiological process that produces midazolam’s ceiling effect.\nBut even if Dr. Lubarsky’s declaration is correct, it is\nlargely beside the point. What matters for present pur-\nposes is the dosage at which the ceiling effect kicks in, not\nthe biological process that produces the effect.

First, we are not persuaded by petitioners’\nargument that Dr. Evans’ testimony should have been\nrejected because of some of the sources listed in his report.\nPetitioners criticize two of the “selected references” that\nDr. Evans cited in his expert report: the Web site\ndrugs.com and a material safety data sheet (MSDS) about\nmidazolam. Petitioners’ argument is more of a Daubert\nchallenge to Dr. Evans’ testimony than an argument that\nthe District Court’s findings were clearly erroneous. The\nDistrict Court concluded that Dr. Evans was “well-\nqualified to give the expert testimony that he gave” and\nthat “his testimony was the product of reliable principles\nand methods reliably applied to the facts of this case.”\nApp. 75–76. To the extent that the reliability of Dr.\nEvans’ testimony is even before us, the District Court’s con-\nclusion that his testimony was based on reliable sources is\nreviewed under the deferential “abuse-of-discretion”\nstandard. General Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U. S. 136, 142–\n143 (1997). Dr. Evans relied on multiple sources and his\nown expertise, and his testimony may not be disqualified\nsimply because one source (drugs.com) warns that it “ ‘is\nnot intended for medical advice’ ” and another (the MSDS)\nstates that its information is provided “ ‘without any war-\nranty, express or implied, regarding its correctness.’ ”\nBrief for Petitioners 36.

Dr. Evans stated in his expert report\nthat the lowest dose of midazolam resulting in human\ndeaths, according to an MSDS, is 0.071 mg/kg delivered\nintravenously. App. 294. Dr. Lubarsky agreed with this\nstatement. Specifically, he testified that fatalities have\noccurred in doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg, and he\nstated that Dr. Evans’ testimony to that effect was “a true\nstatement” (though he added those fatalities occurred\namong the elderly). Id., at 217. We do not understand\npetitioners to dispute the testimony of Dr. Evans and their\nown expert that 0.071 mg/kg is a potentially fatal dose of\nmidazolam. Instead, they make much of the fact that the\nMSDS attached to Dr. Evans’ report apparently contained\na typographical error and reported the lowest toxic dose as\n71 mg/kg. That Dr. Evans did not repeat that incorrect\nfigure but instead reported the correct dose supports\nrather than undermines his testimony. In any event, the\nalleged error in the MSDS is irrelevant because the Dis-\ntrict Court expressly stated that it did not rely on the\nfigure in the MSDS. See id., at 75.\n   Third, petitioners argue that there is no consensus\namong the States regarding midazolam’s efficacy because\nonly four States (Oklahoma, Arizona, Florida, and Ohio)\nhave used midazolam as part of an execution. Petitioners\nrely on the plurality’s statement in Baze that “it is difficult\nto regard a practice as ‘objectively intolerable’ when it is in\nfact widely tolerated,” and the plurality’s emphasis on the\nfact that 36 States had adopted lethal injection and 30\nStates used the particular three-drug protocol at issue in\nthat case. 553 U.

That argument, if accepted,\nwould hamper the adoption of new and potentially more\nhumane methods of execution and would prevent States\nfrom adapting to changes in the availability of suitable\ndrugs.\n   Fourth, petitioners argue that difficulties with Oklaho-\nma’s execution of Lockett and Arizona’s July 2014 execu-\ntion of Joseph Wood establish that midazolam is sure or\nvery likely to cause serious pain. We are not persuaded.\nAside from the Lockett execution, 12 other executions\nhave been conducted using the three-drug protocol at issue\nhere, and those appear to have been conducted without\nany significant problems. See Brief for Respondents 32;\nBrief for State of Florida as Amicus Curiae 1. Moreover,\nLockett was administered only 100 milligrams of midazo-\nlam, and Oklahoma’s investigation into that execution\nconcluded that the difficulties were due primarily to the\nexecution team’s inability to obtain an IV access site. And\nthe Wood execution did not involve the protocol at issue\nhere. Wood did not receive a single dose of 500 milligrams\nof midazolam; instead, he received fifteen 50-milligram\ndoses over the span of two hours.8 Brief for Respondents\n——————\n  8 The principal dissent emphasizes Dr. Lubarsky’s testimony that it is\n\nirrelevant that Wood was administered the drug over a 2-hour period.\nPost, at 20.

The scene is familiar:\nPetitioners, sentenced to die for the crimes they committed\n(including, in the case of one petitioner since put to death,\nraping and murdering an 11–month-old baby), come before\nthis Court asking us to nullify their sentences as “cruel\nand unusual” under the Eighth Amendment.

They were duly convicted and sen-\ntenced. They were granted the right to appeal and to seek\npostconviction relief, first in state and then in federal\ncourt. And now, acknowledging that their convictions are\nunassailable, they ask us for clemency, as though clemency\nwere ours to give.\n   The response is also familiar: A vocal minority of the\nCourt, waving over their heads a ream of the most recent\nabolitionist studies (a superabundant genre) as though\n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 [35] "2                    GLOSSIP v. GROSS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nthey have discovered the lost folios of Shakespeare, insist\nthat now, at long last, the death penalty must be abolished\nfor good. Mind you, not once in the history of the Ameri-\ncan Republic has this Court ever suggested the death\npenalty is categorically impermissible. The reason is\nobvious: It is impossible to hold unconstitutional that\nwhich the Constitution explicitly contemplates. The Fifth\nAmendment provides that “[n]o person shall be held to\nanswer for a capital . . . crime, unless on a presentment or\nindictment of a Grand Jury,” and that no person shall be\n“deprived of life . . . without due process of law.” Never-\ntheless, today JUSTICE BREYER takes on the role of the\nabolitionists in this long-running drama, arguing that the\ntext of the Constitution and two centuries of history must\nyield to his “20 years of experience on this Court,” and\ninviting full briefing on the continued permissibility of\ncapital punishment, post, at 2 (dissenting opinion).\n  Historically, the Eighth Amendment was understood to\nbar only those punishments that added “ ‘terror, pain, or\ndisgrace’ ” to an otherwise permissible capital sentence.\nBaze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 96 (2008) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring in judgment). Rather than bother with this troubling\ndetail, JUSTICE BREYER elects to contort the constitutional\ntext. Redefining “cruel” to mean “unreliable,” “arbitrary,”\nor causing “excessive delays,” and “unusual” to include a\n“decline in use,” he proceeds to offer up a white paper\ndevoid of any meaningful legal argument.\n  Even accepting JUSTICE BREYER’s rewriting of the\nEighth Amendment, his argument is full of internal con-\ntradictions and (it must be said) gobbledy-gook. He says\nthat the death penalty is cruel because it is unreliable; but\nit is convictions, not punishments, that are unreliable.\nMoreover, the “pressure on police, prosecutors, and jurors\nto secure a conviction,” which he claims increases the risk\nof wrongful convictions in capital cases, flows from the\nnature of the crime, not the punishment that follows its\n"

JUSTICE BREYER acknowledges as\nmuch: “[T]he crimes at issue in capital cases are typically\nhorrendous murders, and thus accompanied by intense\ncommunity pressure.” Ibid. That same pressure would\nexist, and the same risk of wrongful convictions, if horren-\ndous death-penalty cases were converted into equally\nhorrendous life-without-parole cases. The reality is that\nany innocent defendant is infinitely better off appealing a\ndeath sentence than a sentence of life imprisonment.\n(Which, again, JUSTICE BREYER acknowledges: “[C]ourts\n(or State Governors) are 130 times more likely to exoner-\nate a defendant where a death sentence is at issue,” post,\nat 5.) The capital convict will obtain endless legal assis-\ntance from the abolition lobby (and legal favoritism from\nabolitionist judges), while the lifer languishes unnoticed\nbehind bars.\n   JUSTICE BREYER next says that the death penalty is\ncruel because it is arbitrary. To prove this point, he points\nto a study of 205 cases that “measured the ‘egregiousness’\nof the murderer’s conduct” with “a system of metrics,” and\nthen “compared the egregiousness of the conduct of the 9\ndefendants sentenced to death with the egregiousness of\nthe conduct of defendants in the remaining 196 cases [who\nwere not sentenced to death],” post, at 10–11. If only\nAristotle, Aquinas, and Hume knew that moral philosophy\ncould be so neatly distilled into a pocket-sized, vade me-\ncum “system of metrics.” Of course it cannot: Egregious-\nness is a moral judgment susceptible of few hard-and-fast\nrules. More importantly, egregiousness of the crime is\nonly one of several factors that render a punishment con-\ndign—culpability, rehabilitative potential, and the need\nfor deterrence also are relevant. That is why this Court\nhas required an individualized consideration of all miti-\ngating circumstances, rather than formulaic application of\nsome egregiousness test.\n   It is because these questions are contextual and admit of\n"

The fact that\nthese judgments may vary across cases is an inevitable\nconsequence of the jury trial, that cornerstone of Anglo-\nAmerican judicial procedure. But when a punishment is\nauthorized by law—if you kill you are subject to death—\nthe fact that some defendants receive mercy from their\njury no more renders the underlying punishment “cruel”\nthan does the fact that some guilty individuals are never\napprehended, are never tried, are acquitted, or are\npardoned.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s third reason that the death penalty is\ncruel is that it entails delay, thereby (1) subjecting in-\nmates to long periods on death row and (2) undermining\nthe penological justifications of the death penalty. The\nfirst point is nonsense. Life without parole is an even\nlengthier period than the wait on death row; and if the\nobjection is that death row is a more confining environ-\nment, the solution should be modifying the environment\nrather than abolishing the death penalty. As for the\nargument that delay undermines the penological ration-\nales for the death penalty: In insisting that “the major\nalternative to capital punishment—namely, life in prison\nwithout possibility of parole—also incapacitates,” post, at\n24, JUSTICE BREYER apparently forgets that one of the\nplaintiffs in this very case was already in prison when he\ncommitted the murder that landed him on death row.\nJUSTICE BREYER further asserts that “whatever interest in\nretribution might be served by the death penalty as cur-\nrently administered, that interest can be served almost as\nwell by a sentence of life in prison without parole,” post, at\n27. My goodness. If he thinks the death penalty not much\nmore harsh (and hence not much more retributive), why is\nhe so keen to get rid of it? With all due respect, whether\nthe death penalty and life imprisonment constitute more-\nor-less equivalent retribution is a question far above the\n"

Perhaps JUSTICE BREYER is more\nforgiving—or more enlightened—than those who, like\nKant, believe that death is the only just punishment for\ntaking a life. I would not presume to tell parents whose\nlife has been forever altered by the brutal murder of a\nchild that life imprisonment is punishment enough.\n   And finally, JUSTICE BREYER speculates that it does not\n“seem likely” that the death penalty has a “significant”\ndeterrent effect. Post, at 25. It seems very likely to me,\nand there are statistical studies that say so. See, e.g.,\nZimmerman, State Executions, Deterrence, and the Inci-\ndence of Murder, 7 J. Applied Econ. 163, 166 (2004) (“[I]t\nis estimated that each state execution deters approximately\nfourteen murders per year on average”); Dezhbakhsh,\nRubin, &amp; Shepherd, Does Capital Punishment Have a\nDeterrent Effect? New Evidence from Postmoratorium\nPanel Data, 5 Am. L. &amp; Econ. Rev. 344 (2003) (“[E]ach\nexecution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders”\nper year); Sunstein &amp; Vermeule, Is Capital Punishment\nMorally Required? Acts, Omissions, and Life-Life\nTradeoffs, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 703, 713 (2005) (“All in all, the\nrecent evidence of a deterrent effect from capital punish-\nment seems impressive, especially in light of its ‘apparent\npower and unanimity’ ”). But we federal judges live in a\nworld apart from the vast majority of Americans. After\nwork, we retire to homes in placid suburbia or to high-rise\nco-ops with guards at the door. We are not confronted\nwith the threat of violence that is ever present in many\nAmericans’ everyday lives. The suggestion that the in-\ncremental deterrent effect of capital punishment does not\nseem “significant” reflects, it seems to me, a let-them-eat-\ncake obliviousness to the needs of others. Let the People\ndecide how much incremental deterrence is appropriate.\n   Of course, this delay is a problem of the Court’s own\nmaking.

But by 2014, he tells us, it\ntook an average of 18 years to carry out a death sentence.\nId., at 19. What happened in the intervening years?\nNothing other than the proliferation of labyrinthine re-\nstrictions on capital punishment, promulgated by this\nCourt under an interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\nthat empowered it to divine “the evolving standards of\ndecency that mark the progress of a maturing society,”\nTrop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opin-\nion)—a task for which we are eminently ill suited. Indeed,\nfor the past two decades, JUSTICE BREYER has been the\nDrum Major in this parade. His invocation of the result-\nant delay as grounds for abolishing the death penalty calls\nto mind the man sentenced to death for killing his parents,\nwho pleads for mercy on the ground that he is an orphan.\nAmplifying the surrealism of his argument, JUSTICE\nBREYER uses the fact that many States have abandoned\ncapital punishment—have abandoned it precisely because\nof the costs those suspect decisions have imposed—to\nconclude that it is now “unusual.” Post, at 33–39. (A\ncaution to the reader: Do not use the creative arithmetic\nthat JUSTICE BREYER employs in counting the number of\nStates that use the death penalty when you prepare your\nnext tax return; outside the world of our Eighth Amend-\nment abolitionist-inspired jurisprudence, it will be regarded\nas more misrepresentation than math.)\n   If we were to travel down the path that JUSTICE BREYER\nsets out for us and once again consider the constitutionality\nof the death penalty, I would ask that counsel also brief\nwhether our cases that have abandoned the historical\nunderstanding of the Eighth Amendment, beginning with\nTrop, should be overruled. That case has caused more\nmischief to our jurisprudence, to our federal system, and\nto our society than any other that comes to mind.

That claim has no foundation in the\nEighth Amendment, which prohibits only those “method[s]\nof execution” that are “deliberately designed to inflict\npain.” Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 94 (2008) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). Because petitioners make no\nallegation that Oklahoma adopted its lethal injection\nprotocol “to add elements of terror, pain, or disgrace to the\ndeath penalty,” they have no valid claim.

His conclusion is based on an analysis\nthat itself provides a powerful case against enforcing an\nimaginary constitutional rule against “arbitrariness.”\n   The thrust of JUSTICE BREYER’s argument is that empir-\nical studies performed by death penalty abolitionists\nreveal that the assignment of death sentences does not\nnecessarily correspond to the “egregiousness” of the\ncrimes, but instead appears to be correlated to “arbitrary”\nfactors, such as the locality in which the crime was com-\nmitted. Relying on these studies to determine the consti-\ntutionality of the death penalty fails to respect the values\nimplicit in the Constitution’s allocation of decisionmaking\nin this context. The Donohue study, on which JUSTICE\nBREYER relies most heavily, measured the “egregiousness”\n(or “deathworthiness”) of murders by asking lawyers to\nidentify the legal grounds for aggravation in each case,\nand by asking law students to evaluate written summaries\nof the murders and assign “egregiousness” scores based on\na rubric designed to capture and standardize their moral\njudgments.

This\nexercise in some ways approximates the function per-\nformed by jurors, but there is at least one critical differ-\nence: The law students make their moral judgments based\non written summaries—they do not sit through hours,\ndays, or weeks of evidence detailing the crime; they do not\nhave an opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses,\nto see the remorse of the defendant, to feel the impact of\nthe crime on the victim’s family; they do not bear the\nburden of deciding the fate of another human being; and\nthey are not drawn from the community whose sense of\nsecurity and justice may have been torn asunder by an act\nof callous disregard for human life.

III, §2, cl. 3.\nAnd the Sixth Amendment promises that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . .\ntrial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein\nthe crime shall have been committed.” Those provisions\nensure that capital defendants are given the option to be\nsentenced by a jury of their peers who, collectively, are\nbetter situated to make the moral judgment between life\nand death than are the products of contemporary Ameri-\ncan law schools.\n   It should come as no surprise, then, that the primary\nexplanation a regression analysis revealed for the gap\nbetween the egregiousness scores and the actual sentences\nwas not the race or sex of the offender or victim, but the\nlocality in which the crime was committed.

The\nconstitutional provisions just quoted, which place such\ndecisions in the hands of jurors and trial courts located\nwhere “the crime shall have been committed,” seem delib-\nerately designed to introduce that factor.\n   In any event, the results of these studies are inherently\nunreliable because they purport to control for egregious-\nness by quantifying moral depravity in a process that is\nitself arbitrary, not to mention dehumanizing. One such\nstudy’s explanation of how the author assigned “depravity\npoints” to identify the “worst of the worst” murderers\nproves the point well. McCord, Lightning Still Strikes, 71\nBrooklyn L.

(Do not worry, the author\nreassures us, “many killers of police officers accrue de-\npravity points in other ways that clearly put them among\nthe worst criminals.” Id., at 836.) Killing a child under\nthe age of 12 was worth two depravity points, because\nsuch an act “seems particularly heartless,” but killing\nsomeone over the age of 70 earned the murderer only one,\nfor although “elderly victims tug at our hearts,” they do so\n“less” than children “because the promise of a long life is\nless.” Id., at 836, 838. Killing to make a political state-\nment was worth three depravity points; killing out of\nracial hatred, only two. Id., at 835, 837.

In\nKennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407 (2008), the Court\ngranted relief to a man who had been sentenced to death\nfor raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The rape was so\nviolent that it “separated her cervix from the back of her\nvagina, causing her rectum to protrude into the vaginal\nstructure,” and tore her “entire perineum . . . from the\nposterior fourchette to the anus.” Id., at 414. The evi-\ndence indicated that the petitioner spent at least an hour\nand half attempting to destroy the evidence of his crime\nbefore seeking emergency assistance, even as his step-\ndaughter bled profusely from her injuries. Id., at 415.\nAnd in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.

He shot his father\nand his father’s girlfriend pointblank in the face as they\npleaded for their lives. Id., at 5–6. He then tracked the\ngirls down in their hiding places and slit their throats,\nleaving them alive for several minutes as they drowned in\ntheir own blood. Id., at 6–7.\n   Whatever one’s views on the permissibility or wisdom of\nthe death penalty, I doubt anyone would disagree that\neach of these crimes was egregious enough to merit the\nseverest condemnation that society has to offer.

But rather than try to\npatch up the death penalty’s legal wounds one at a time, I\nwould ask for full briefing on a more basic question:\nwhether the death penalty violates the Constitution.\n   The relevant legal standard is the standard set forth in\nthe Eighth Amendment. The Constitution there forbids\nthe “inflict[ion]” of “cruel and unusual punishments.”\nAmdt. 8. The Court has recognized that a “claim that\npunishment is excessive is judged not by the standards\nthat prevailed in 1685 when Lord Jeffreys presided over\nthe ‘Bloody Assizes’ or when the Bill of Rights was adopted,\nbut rather by those that currently prevail.” Atkins v.\nVirginia, 536 U. S. 304, 311 (2002). Indeed, the Constitu­\ntion prohibits various gruesome punishments that were\ncommon in Blackstone’s day. See 4 W. Blackstone, Com­\nmentaries on the Laws of England 369–370 (1769) (listing\nmutilation and dismembering, among other punishments).\n   Nearly 40 years ago, this Court upheld the death pen­\nalty under statutes that, in the Court’s view, contained\nsafeguards sufficient to ensure that the penalty would be\napplied reliably and not arbitrarily.

The circumstances and the evidence of the\ndeath penalty’s application have changed radically since\nthen. Given those changes, I believe that it is now time to\nreopen the question.\n   In 1976, the Court thought that the constitutional in­\nfirmities in the death penalty could be healed; the Court in\neffect delegated significant responsibility to the States to\ndevelop procedures that would protect against those con­\nstitutional problems. Almost 40 years of studies, surveys,\nand experience strongly indicate, however, that this effort\nhas failed. Today’s administration of the death penalty\ninvolves three fundamental constitutional defects: (1)\nserious unreliability, (2) arbitrariness in application, and\n(3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death\npenalty’s penological purpose. Perhaps as a result, (4)\nmost places within the United States have abandoned its\nuse.\n   I shall describe each of these considerations, emphasiz­\ning changes that have occurred during the past four dec­\nades. For it is those changes, taken together with my own\n20 years of experience on this Court, that lead me to be­\nlieve that the death penalty, in and of itself, now likely\nconstitutes a legally prohibited “cruel and unusual pun­\nishmen[t].” U.

In the view of researchers\nwho have conducted these studies, it could be so because\nthe crimes at issue in capital cases are typically horren­\ndous murders, and thus accompanied by intense community\npressure on police, prosecutors, and jurors to secure a\nconviction. This pressure creates a greater likelihood of\nconvicting the wrong person. See Gross, Jacoby, Mathe-\nson, Montgomery, &amp; Patil, Exonerations in the United\nStates 1989 Through 2003, 95 J. Crim.

Garrett,\nConvicting the Innocent: Where Criminal Prosecutions Go\nWrong (2011) (discussing other common causes of wrong­\nful convictions generally including false confessions, mis­\ntaken eyewitness testimony, untruthful jailhouse inform­\nants, and ineffective defense counsel).\n   In the case of Cameron Todd Willingham, for example,\nwho (as noted earlier) was executed despite likely inno­\ncence, the State Bar of Texas recently filed formal miscon­\nduct charges against the lead prosecutor for his actions—\nactions that may have contributed to Willingham’s convic­\ntion. Possley, Prosecutor Accused of Misconduct in Death\nPenalty Case, Washington Post, Mar. 19, 2015, p. A3. And\nin Glenn Ford’s case, the prosecutor admitted that he was\npartly responsible for Ford’s wrongful conviction, issuing a\npublic apology to Ford and explaining that, at the time of\nFord’s conviction, he was “not as interested in justice as\n[he] was in winning.” Stroud, supra.\n   Other factors may also play a role.

Application of the studies’ metrics made\nclear that only 1 of those 9 defendants was indeed the\n“worst of the worst” (or was, at least, within the 15%\nconsidered most “egregious”).

Every murder is tragic, but unless we\nreturn to the mandatory death penalty struck down in\nWoodson, 428 U.

And this extensive\nbody of evidence suggests that it is not so limited.\n   Four decades ago, the Court believed it possible to in­\nterpret the Eighth Amendment in ways that would signifi­\ncantly limit the arbitrary application of the death sen­\ntence. See Gregg, 428 U. S., at 195 (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.)

In\nan oral argument last year, for example, the State admit­\nted that the last 10 prisoners executed in Florida had\nspent an average of nearly 25 years on death row before\nexecution. Tr. of Oral Arg. in Hall v. Florida, O. T. 2013,\nNo. 12–10882, p. 46.\n   The length of the average delay has increased dramati­\ncally over the years. In 1960, the average delay between\nsentencing and execution was two years.

Dec.\n2014) (hereinafter BJS 2013 Stats). By last year the\naverage had risen to about 18 years. DPIC, Execution List\n2014, supra. Nearly half of the 3,000 inmates now on\ndeath row have been there for more than 15 years. And,\nat present execution rates, it would take more than 75\nyears to carry out those 3,000 death sentences; thus, the\naverage person on death row would spend an additional\n37.5 years there before being executed.

See Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U. S. 1067, 1069\n(2009) (Stevens, J., statement respecting denial of certio­\nrari). First, a lengthy delay in and of itself is especially\ncruel because it “subjects death row inmates to decades of\nespecially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confine­\nment.” Ibid.; Gomez v. Fierro, 519 U. S. 918 (1996) (Ste­\nvens, J., dissenting) (excessive delays from sentencing to\nexecution can themselves “constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment”); see\nalso Lackey v.

Second, lengthy delay under­\nmines the death penalty’s penological rationale. Johnson,\nsupra, at 1069; Thompson v. McNeil, 556 U.

American Civil Liberties\nUnion (ACLU), A Death Before Dying: Solitary Confine­\nment on Death Row 5 (July 2013) (ACLU Report). This\noccurs even though the ABA has suggested that death row\ninmates be housed in conditions similar to the general\npopulation, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on\nTorture has called for a global ban on solitary confinement\nlonger than 15 days. See id., at 2, 4; ABA Standards for\nCriminal Justice: Treatment of Prisoners 6 (3d ed. 2011).\nAnd it is well documented that such prolonged solitary\nconfinement produces numerous deleterious harms. See,\ne.g., Haney, Mental Health Issues in Long-Term Solitary\nand “Supermax” Confinement, 49 Crime &amp; Delinquency\n124, 130 (2003) (cataloguing studies finding that solitary\nconfinement can cause prisoners to experience “anxiety,\npanic, rage, loss of control, paranoia, hallucinations, and\nself-mutilations,” among many other symptoms); Grassian,\nPsychiatric Effects of Solitary Confinement, 22 Wash\nU.

S. 160, 167–168 (1890); see also Davis v.\nAyala, ante, at 1–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   The dehumanizing effect of solitary confinement is\naggravated by uncertainty as to whether a death sentence\nwill in fact be carried out. In 1890, this Court recognized\nthat, “when a prisoner sentenced by a court to death is\nconfined in the penitentiary awaiting the execution of the\nsentence, one of the most horrible feelings to which he can\nbe subjected during that time is the uncertainty during\nthe whole of it.” Medley, supra, at 172. The Court was\nthere describing a delay of a mere four weeks. In the past\ncentury and a quarter, little has changed in this respect—\nexcept for duration. Today we must describe delays meas­\nured, not in weeks, but in decades.

But the major\nalternative to capital punishment—namely, life in prison\nwithout possibility of parole—also incapacitates. See Ring\nv. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 615 (2002) (BREYER, J., concur­\nring in judgment).\n   Thus, as the Court has recognized, the death penalty’s\npenological rationale in fact rests almost exclusively upon\na belief in its tendency to deter and upon its ability to\nsatisfy a community’s interest in retribution.

GROSS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Thus an offender who is sentenced to death is two or\nthree times more likely to find his sentence overturned or\ncommuted than to be executed; and he has a good chance\nof dying from natural causes before any execution (or\nexoneration) can take place. In a word, executions are\nrare. And an individual contemplating a crime but evalu­\nating the potential punishment would know that, in any\nevent, he faces a potential sentence of life without parole.\n   These facts, when recurring, must have some offsetting\neffect on a potential perpetrator’s fear of a death penalty.\nAnd, even if that effect is no more than slight, it makes it\ndifficult to believe (given the studies of deterrence cited\nearlier) that such a rare event significantly deters horren­\ndous crimes. See Furman, 408 U. S., at 311–312 (White,\nJ., concurring) (It cannot “be said with confidence that\nsociety’s need for specific deterrence justifies death for so\nfew when for so many in like circumstances life imprison­\nment or shorter prison terms are judged sufficient”).\n   But what about retribution? Retribution is a valid\npenological goal. I recognize that surviving relatives of\nvictims of a horrendous crime, or perhaps the community\nitself, may find vindication in an execution. And a com­\nmunity that favors the death penalty has an understand-\nable interest in representing their voices. But see A. Sarat,\nMercy on Trial: What It Means To Stop an Execution 130\n(2005) (Illinois Governor George Ryan explained his deci­\nsion to commute all death sentences on the ground that it\nwas “cruel and unusual” for “family members to go\nthrough this . . . legal limbo for [20] years”).\n   The relevant question here, however, is whether a\n“community’s sense of retribution” can often find vindica­\ntion in “a death that comes,” if at all, “only several decades\nafter the crime was committed.” Valle v. Florida, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (BREYER, J., dissenting from denial of\nstay) (slip op., at 3). By then the community is a different\ngroup of people.

The offender may have found himself a changed\nhuman being. And sometimes repentance and even for­\ngiveness can restore meaning to lives once ruined. At the\nsame time, the community and victims’ families will know\nthat, even without a further death, the offender will serve\ndecades in prison under a sentence of life without parole.\n  I recognize, of course, that this may not always be the\ncase, and that sometimes the community believes that an\nexecution could provide closure. Nevertheless, the delays\nand low probability of execution must play some role in\nany calculation that leads a community to insist on death\nas retribution. As I have already suggested, they may well\nattenuate the community’s interest in retribution to the\npoint where it cannot by itself amount to a significant\njustification for the death penalty. Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n3). In any event, I believe that whatever interest in retri­\nbution might be served by the death penalty as currently\nadministered, that interest can be served almost as well\nby a sentence of life in prison without parole (a sentence\nthat every State now permits, see ACLU, A Living Death:\nLife Without Parole for Nonviolent Offenses 11, and n. 10\n(2013)).\n  Finally, the fact of lengthy delays undermines any effort\nto justify the death penalty in terms of its prevalence\nwhen the Founders wrote the Eighth Amendment. When\nthe Founders wrote the Constitution, there were no 20- or\n30-year delays. Execution took place soon after sentenc­\ning. See P.

And this Court has said that, if the\ndeath penalty does not fulfill the goals of deterrence or\nretribution, “it is nothing more than the purposeless and\nneedless imposition of pain and suffering and hence an\nunconstitutional punishment.” Atkins, 536 U.

The Committee presented a report to Congress,\nand Justice Powell testified that “[d]elay robs the penalty\nof much of its deterrent value.” Habeas Corpus Reform,\nHearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n100th Cong., 1st and 2d Sess., 35 (1989 and 1990). Justice\nPowell, according to his official biographer, ultimately\nconcluded that capital punishment:\n    “ ‘serves no useful purpose.’ The United States was\n    ‘unique among the industrialized nations of the West\n    in maintaining the death penalty,’ and it was enforced\n    so rarely that it could not deter. More important, the\n    haggling and delay and seemingly endless litigation in\n    every capital case brought the law itself into disre­\n    pute.” Jeffries, supra, at 452.\nIn short, the problem of excessive delays led Justice Pow­\nell, at least in part, to conclude that the death penalty was\nunconstitutional.\n   As I have said, today delays are much worse. When\nChief Justice Rehnquist appointed Justice Powell to the\nCommittee, the average delay between sentencing and\nexecution was 7 years and 11 months, compared with 17\nyears and 7 months today.

Why can they not take\nsteps to shorten the time between sentence and execution,\nand thereby mitigate the problems just raised?

Recall the case of Henry\nLee McCollum, whom DNA evidence exonerated 30 years\nafter his conviction. Katz &amp; Eckholm, N. Y. Times, at A1.\nIf McCollum had been executed earlier, he would not have\nlived to see the day when DNA evidence exonerated him\nand implicated another man; that man is already serving\na life sentence for a rape and murder that he committed\njust a few weeks after the murder McCollum was convicted\nof.

And yet a full 20 years after the Court denied\nreview, McCollum was exonerated by DNA evidence.\nThere are a significant number of similar cases, some of\nwhich I have discussed earlier. See also DPIC Innocence\nList, supra (Nathson Fields, 23 years; Paul House, 23\nyears; Nicholas Yarris, 21 years; Anthony Graves, 16\nyears; Damon Thibodeaux, 15 years; Ricky Jackson, Wiley\nBridgeman, and Kwame Ajamu, all exonerated for the\nsame crime 39 years after their convictions).\n   In addition to those who are exonerated on the ground\nthat they are innocent, there are other individuals whose\nsentences or convictions have been overturned for other\nreasons (as discussed above, state and federal courts found\nerror in 68% of the capital cases they reviewed between\n1973 and 1995). See Part I, supra. In many of these\ncases, a court will have found that the individual did not\nmerit the death penalty in a special sense—namely, he\nfailed to receive all the procedural protections that the law\nrequires for the death penalty’s application.

S., at 998 (BREYER, J., dissenting from\ndenial of certiorari) (one of the primary causes of the delay\nis the States’ “failure to apply constitutionally sufficient\nprocedures at the time of initial [conviction or] sentenc­\ning”). But a death penalty system that minimizes delays\nwould undermine the legal system’s efforts to secure relia­\nbility and procedural fairness.\n   In this world, or at least in this Nation, we can have a\ndeath penalty that at least arguably serves legitimate\npenological purposes or we can have a procedural system\nthat at least arguably seeks reliability and fairness in the\ndeath penalty’s application. We cannot have both.

Last year, in 2014, only seven States\ncarried out an execution. Perhaps more importantly, in\nthe last two decades, the imposition and implementation\nof the death penalty have increasingly become unusual. I\ncan illustrate the significant decline in the use of the\ndeath penalty in several ways.\n   An appropriate starting point concerns the trajectory of\nthe number of annual death sentences nationwide, from\nthe 1970’s to present day. In 1977—just after the Su­\npreme Court made clear that, by modifying their legisla­\ntion, States could reinstate the death penalty—137 people\nwere sentenced to death. BJS 2013 Stats, at 19 (Table 16).\nMany States having revised their death penalty laws to\nmeet Furman’s requirements, the number of death sen­\ntences then increased. Between 1986 and 1999, 286 per­\nsons on average were sentenced to death each year. BJS\n2013 Stats, at 14, 19 (Tables 11 and 16). But, approxi­\nmately 15 years ago, the numbers began to decline, and\nthey have declined rapidly ever since. See Appendix A,\ninfra (showing sentences from 1977–2014). In 1999, 279\n"

DPIC, The\nDeath Penalty in 2014, supra, at 1.\n  Next, one can consider state-level data. Often when\ndeciding whether a punishment practice is, constitutionally\nspeaking, “unusual,” this Court has looked to the num-\nber of States engaging in that practice. Atkins, 536 U.

In 1972, when the Court decided Furman, the death\npenalty was lawful in 41 States. Nine States had abol­\nished it. E. Mandery, A Wild Justice: The Death and\nResurrection of Capital Punishment in America 145\n(2013). As of today, 19 States have abolished the death\npenalty (along with the District of Columbia), although\nsome did so prospectively only. See DPIC, States With\nand Without the Death Penalty, online at http://www.\ndeathpenaltyinfo.org/states-and-without-death-penalty. In\n11 other States that maintain the death penalty on the\nbooks, no execution has taken place for more than eight\nyears: Arkansas (last execution 2005); California (2006);\nColorado (1997); Kansas (no executions since the death\npenalty was reinstated in 1976); Montana (2006); Nevada\n(2006); New Hampshire (no executions since the death\npenalty was reinstated in 1976); North Carolina (2006);\nOregon (1997); Pennsylvania (1999); and Wyoming (1992).\nDPIC, Executions by State and Year, online at http://www.\n"

County-by­\ncounty figures are relevant, for decisions to impose the\ndeath penalty typically take place at a county level. See\nsupra, at 12–13.

By the early 2000’s, the death\npenalty was only actively practiced in a very small number\nof counties: between 2004 and 2009, only 35 counties\nimposed 5 or more death sentences, i.e., approximately one\nper year. See Appendix D, infra (such counties colored in\nred) (citing Ford, The Death Penalty’s Last Stand, The\nAtlantic, Apr. 21, 2015). And more recent data show that\nthe practice has diminished yet further: between 2010 and\n2015 (as of June 22), only 15 counties imposed five or more\ndeath sentences. See Appendix E, infra. In short, the\nnumber of active death penalty counties is small and\ngetting smaller. And the overall statistics on county-level\nexecutions bear this out. Between 1976 and 2007, there\nwere no executions in 86% of America’s counties. Liebman\n&amp; Clarke 265–266, and n. 47; cf. ibid. (counties with less\nthan 5% of the Nation’s population carried out over half of\nits executions from 1976–2007).\n   In sum, if we look to States, in more than 60% there is\neffectively no death penalty, in an additional 18% an\nexecution is rare and unusual, and 6%, i.e., three States,\naccount for 80% of all executions. If we look to population,\nabout 66% of the Nation lives in a State that has not\ncarried out an execution in the last three years. And if we\nlook to counties, in 86% there is effectively no death pen-\nalty. It seems fair to say that it is now unusual to find\ncapital punishment in the United States, at least when we\nconsider the Nation as a whole. See Furman, 408 U. S., at\n311 (1972) (White, J., concurring) (executions could be so\ninfrequently carried out that they “would cease to be a\ncredible deterrent or measurably to contribute to any\nother end of punishment in the criminal justice system . . .\nwhen imposition of the penalty reaches a certain degree\nof infrequency, it would be very doubtful that any exist-\ning general need for retribution would be measurably\nsatisfied”).\n   Moreover, we have said that it “ ‘is not so much the\n"

Cali­\nfornia Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice,\nReport and Recommendations on the Administration of\nthe Death Penalty in California 117 (June 30, 2008) (death\npenalty costs California $137 million per year; a compara­\nble system of life imprisonment without parole would cost\n$11.5 million per year), online at http://www.ccfaj.org/rr­\ndp-official.html; Dáte, The High Price of Killing Killers,\nPalm Beach Post, Jan. 4, 2000, p. 1A (cost of each execu­\ntion is $23 million above cost of life imprisonment without\nparole in Florida).\n   The answer is that the matters I have discussed, such as\nlack of reliability, the arbitrary application of a serious\nand irreversible punishment, individual suffering caused\nby long delays, and lack of penological purpose are quin­\ntessentially judicial matters. They concern the infliction—\nindeed the unfair, cruel, and unusual infliction—of a\nserious punishment upon an individual. I recognize that\nin 1972 this Court, in a sense, turned to Congress and the\nstate legislatures in its search for standards that would\nincrease the fairness and reliability of imposing a death\npenalty. The legislatures responded. But, in the last four\ndecades, considerable evidence has accumulated that\nthose responses have not worked.\n   Thus we are left with a judicial responsibility. The\nEighth Amendment sets forth the relevant law, and we\nmust interpret that law. See Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 177 (1803); Hall, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n19) (“That exercise of independent judgment is the Court’s\njudicial duty”).

GROSS, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n                        [June 29, 2015]\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG,\nJUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n   Petitioners, three inmates on Oklahoma’s death row,\nchallenge the constitutionality of the State’s lethal injec­\ntion protocol. The State plans to execute petitioners using\nthree drugs: midazolam, rocuronium bromide, and potas­\nsium chloride. The latter two drugs are intended to para­\nlyze the inmate and stop his heart. But they do so in a\ntorturous manner, causing burning, searing pain. It is\nthus critical that the first drug, midazolam, do what it is\nsupposed to do, which is to render and keep the inmate\nunconscious. Petitioners claim that midazolam cannot be\nexpected to perform that function, and they have presented\nample evidence showing that the State’s planned use of\nthis drug poses substantial, constitutionally intolerable\nrisks.\n   Nevertheless, the Court today turns aside petitioners’\nplea that they at least be allowed a stay of execution while\nthey seek to prove midazolam’s inadequacy. The Court\nachieves this result in two ways: first, by deferring to the\nDistrict Court’s decision to credit the scientifically unsup­\nported and implausible testimony of a single expert wit­\nness; and second, by faulting petitioners for failing to\nsatisfy the wholly novel requirement of proving the avail­\nability of an alternative means for their own executions.\n"

Rees, 553 U. S. 35 (2008), the Court addressed\nthe application of this mandate to Kentucky’s lethal injec­\ntion protocol. At that time, Kentucky, like at least 29 of\nthe 35 other States with the death penalty, utilized a\nseries of three drugs to perform executions: (1) sodium\nthiopental, a “fast-acting barbiturate sedative that induces\na deep, comalike unconsciousness when given in the\namounts used for lethal injection”; (2) pancuronium bro­\nmide, “a paralytic agent that inhibits all muscular-skeletal\nmovements and . . . stops respiration”; and (3) potassium\nchloride, which “interferes with the electrical signals that\nstimulate the contractions of the heart, inducing cardiac\narrest.” Id., at 44 (plurality opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.).\n   In Baze, it was undisputed that absent a “proper dose of\nsodium thiopental,” there would be a “substantial, consti­\ntutionally unacceptable risk of suffocation from the admin­\nistration of pancuronium bromide and pain from the injec­\ntion of potassium chloride.” Id., at 53. That is because, if\ngiven to a conscious inmate, pancuronium bromide would\nleave him or her asphyxiated and unable to demonstrate\n“any outward sign of distress,” while potassium chloride\nwould cause “excruciating pain.” Id., at 71 (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). But the Baze petitioners conceded\nthat if administered as intended, Kentucky’s method of\nexecution would nevertheless “result in a humane death,”\nid., at 41 (plurality opinion), as the “proper administra­\ntion” of sodium thiopental “eliminates any meaningful risk\nthat a prisoner would experience pain from the subse­\n"

But 10 minutes later—\napproximately 40 minutes after the execution began—\nLockett was pronounced dead. Id., at 395.\n   The State stayed all future executions while it sought to\ndetermine what had gone wrong in Lockett’s. Five months\nlater, the State released an investigative report identify­\ning a flaw in the IV line as the principal difficulty: The IV\nhad failed to fully deliver the lethal drugs into Lockett’s\nveins. Id., at 398. An autopsy determined, however, that\nthe concentration of midazolam in Lockett’s blood was\nmore than sufficient to render an average person uncon­\nscious.

The new protocol contains a number of\nprocedures designed to guarantee that members of the\nexecution team are able to insert the IV properly, and\ncharges them with ensuring that the inmate is uncon­\nscious. Id., at 57–66, 361–369.

The State, in\nturn, based its case on the testimony of Dr. Roswell Evans,\nalso a doctor of pharmacy.\n   To a great extent, the experts’ testimony overlapped.\nAll three experts agreed that midazolam is from a class of\nsedative drugs known as benzodiazepines (a class that\nincludes Valium and Xanax), and that it has no analge­\nsic—or pain-relieving—effects. App. 205 (Lubarsky), 260–\n261 (Sasich), 311 (Evans). They further agreed that while\nmidazolam can be used to render someone unconscious, it\nis not approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)\nfor use as, and is not in fact used as, a “sole drug to pro­\nduce and maintain anesthesia in surgical proceedings.”\nId., at 307, 327 (Evans); see id., at 171 (Lubarsky); id., at\n262 (Sasich). Finally, all three experts recognized that\nmidazolam is subject to a ceiling effect, which means that\nthere is a point at which increasing the dose of the drug\ndoes not result in any greater effect.          Id., at 172\n(Lubarsky), 243 (Sasich), 331 (Evans).\n   The experts’ opinions diverged, however, on the crucial\nquestions of how this ceiling effect operates, and whether\nit will prevent midazolam from keeping a condemned\ninmate unconscious when the second and third lethal\ninjection drugs are administered. Dr. Lubarsky testified\nthat while benzodiazepines such as midazolam may, like\nbarbiturate drugs such as sodium thiopental and pento­\nbarbital, induce unconsciousness by inhibiting neuron\n"

More specifically, Dr. Lubarsky explained that both\nbarbiturates and benzodiazepines initially cause sedation\nby facilitating the binding of a naturally occurring chemi­\ncal called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) with GABA\nreceptors, which then impedes the flow of electrical im­\npulses through the neurons in the central nervous system.\nId., at 206. But at higher doses, barbiturates also act as a\nGABA substitute and mimic its neuron-suppressing ef­\nfects. Ibid. By contrast, benzodiazepines lack this mim­\nicking function, which means their effect is capped at a\nlower level of sedation. Ibid. Critically, according to Dr.\nLubarsky, this ceiling on midazolam’s sedative effect is\nreached before full anesthesia can be achieved. Ibid.\nThus, in his view, while “midazolam unconsciousness is\n. . . sufficient” for “minor procedure[s],” Tr. of Preliminary\nInjunction Hearing 132–133 (Tr.), it is incapable of keep­\ning someone “insensate and immobile in the face of [more]\nnoxious stimuli,” including the extreme pain and discom­\nfort associated with administration of the second and third\ndrugs in Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol, App. 218.\nDr. Sasich endorsed Dr. Lubarsky’s description of the\nceiling effect, and offered similar reasons for reaching the\nsame conclusion. See id., at 243, 248, 262.\n    In support of these assertions, both experts cited a\nvariety of evidence. Dr. Lubarsky emphasized, in particu­\nlar, Arizona’s 2014 execution of Joseph Wood, which had\nbeen conducted using midazolam and the drug hydromor­\nphone rather than the three-drug cocktail Oklahoma\nintends to employ.1 Id., at 176.

Consequently, in his\nview, “as you increase the dose of midazolam, it’s a linear\neffect, so you’re going to continue to get an impact from\nhigher doses of the drug,” id., at 332, until eventually\n“you’re paralyzing the brain,” id., at 314. Dr. Evans also\nunderstood the chemical source of midazolam’s ceiling\neffect somewhat differently from petitioners’ experts.\nAlthough he agreed that midazolam produces its effect by\n“binding to [GABA] receptors,” id., at 293, he appeared to\nbelieve that midazolam produced sedation by “inhibiting\nGABA” from attaching to GABA receptors, not by promot­\ning GABA’s sedative effects, id., at 312. Thus, when asked\nabout Dr. Lubarsky’s description of the ceiling effect, Dr.\nEvans characterized the phenomenon as stemming from\n“the competitive nature of substances trying to attach to\nGABA receptors.” Id., at 313.\n   Dr. Evans cited no scholarly research in support of his\nopinions. Instead, he appeared to rely primarily on two\nsources: the Web site www.drugs.com, and a “Material\nSafety Data Sheet” produced by a midazolam manufacturer.\nSee id., at 303. Both simply contained general infor­\nmation that covered the experts’ areas of agreement.\n"

It began by making a series of\nfactual findings regarding the characteristics of midazo­\nlam and its use in Oklahoma’s execution protocol. Most\nrelevant here, the District Court found that “[t]he proper\nadministration of 500 milligrams of midazolam . . . would\nmake it a virtual certainty that an individual will be at a\nsufficient level of unconsciousness to resist the noxious\nstimuli which could occur from the application of the\nsecond and third drugs.” Id., at 77. Respecting petition­\ners’ contention that there is a “ceiling effect which pre­\nvents an increase in dosage from having a corresponding\nincremental effect on anesthetic depth,” the District Court\nconcluded:\n    “Dr. Evans testified persuasively . . . that whatever\n    the ceiling effect of midazolam may be with respect to\n    anesthesia, which takes effect at the spinal cord level,\n    there is no ceiling effect with respect to the ability of a\n    500 milligram dose of midazolam to effectively para­\n    lyze the brain, a phenomenon which is not anesthesia\n    but does have the effect of shutting down respiration\n    and eliminating the individual’s awareness of pain.”\n    Id., at 78.\n   Having made these findings, the District Court held\nthat petitioners had shown no likelihood of success on the\nmerits of their Eighth Amendment claim for two inde­\npendent reasons. First, it determined that petitioners had\n“failed to establish that proceeding with [their] execu­\ntion[s] . . . on the basis of the revised protocol presents . . .\n‘an objectively intolerable risk of harm.’ ” Id., at 96. Sec­\nond, the District Court held that petitioners were unlikely\nto prevail because they had not identified any “ ‘known and\navailable alternative’ ” means by which they could be\nexecuted—a requirement it understood Baze to impose.\n"

Unlike the Court, however, I would do so without\nabdicating our duty to examine critically the factual predi­\ncates for the District Court’s finding—namely, Dr. Evans’\ntestimony that midazolam has a “ceiling effect” only “at\nthe spinal cord level,” and that a “500 milligram dose of\nmidazolam” can therefore “effectively paralyze the brain.”\nId., at 78.

GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthat a low dose of midazolam may occasionally be toxic,\nsee ante, at 27—an issue I discuss further below—Dr.\nEvans’ testimony seems to have been based on the Web\nsite www.drugs.com. The Court may be right that “peti­\ntioners do not identify any incorrect statements from\ndrugs.com on which Dr. Evans relied.” Ante, at 27. But\nthat is because there were no statements from drugs.com\nthat supported the critically disputed aspects of Dr. Evans’\nopinion. If anything, the Web site supported petitioners’\ncontentions, as it expressly cautioned that midazolam\n“[s]hould not be used alone for maintenance of anesthe­\nsia,” App. H to Pet. for Cert. 6159, and contained no warn­\ning that an excessive dose of midazolam could “paralyze\nthe brain,” see id., at 6528–6529.\n   Most importantly, nothing from drugs.com—or, for that\nmatter, any other source in the record—corroborated Dr.\nEvans’ key testimony that midazolam’s ceiling effect is\nlimited to the spinal cord and does not pertain to the\nbrain. Indeed, the State appears to have disavowed Dr.\nEvans’ spinal-cord theory, refraining from even mention­\ning it in its brief despite the fact that the District Court\nexpressly relied on this testimony as the basis for finding\nthat larger doses of midazolam will have greater anesthetic\neffects. App. 78. The Court likewise assiduously avoids\ndefending this theory.\n   That is likely because this aspect of Dr. Evans’ testi-\nmony was not just unsupported, but was directly refuted by\nthe studies and articles cited by Drs. Lubarsky and Sasich.\nBoth of these experts relied on academic texts describing\nbenzodiazepines’ ceiling effect and explaining why it pre­\nvents these drugs from rendering a person completely\ninsensate. See Stoelting &amp; Hillier 141, 144 (describing\nmidazolam’s ceiling effect and contrasting the drug with\nbarbiturates); Saari 244 (observing that “abolishment of\nperception of environmental stimuli cannot usually be\ngenerated”). One study further made clear that the ceiling\n"

See id., at 250.\n  These scientific sources also appear to demonstrate that\nDr. Evans’ spinal-cord theory—i.e., that midazolam’s\nceiling effect is limited to the spinal cord—was premised\non a basic misunderstanding of midazolam’s mechanism of\naction. I say “appear” not because the sources themselves\nare unclear about how midazolam operates: They plainly\nstate that midazolam functions by promoting GABA’s\ninhibitory effects on the central nervous system. See, e.g.,\nStoelting &amp; Hillier 140. Instead, I use “appear” because\ndiscerning the rationale underlying Dr. Evans’ testimony\nis difficult. His spinal-cord theory might, however, be\nexplained at least in part by his apparent belief that rather\nthan promoting GABA’s inhibitory effects, midazolam\nproduces sedation by “compet[ing]” with GABA and thus\n“inhibit[ing]” GABA’s effect. App. 312–313.2 Regardless, I\nneed not delve too deeply into Dr. Evans’ alternative\nscientific reality. It suffices to say that to the extent that\nDr. Evans’ testimony was based on his understanding of\nthe source of midazolam’s pharmacological properties, that\nunderstanding was wrong.\n——————\n  2 The Court disputes this characterization of Dr. Evans’ testimony,\n\ninsisting that Dr. Evans accurately described midazolam’s properties in\nthe written report he submitted prior to the hearing below, and sug­\ngesting that petitioners’ experts would have “dispute[d] the accuracy” of\nthis explanation were it in fact wrong. Ante, at 25. But Dr. Evans’\nwritten report simply said midazolam “produces different levels of\ncentral nervous system (CNS) depression through binding to [GABA]\nreceptors.” App. 293. That much is true. Only after Drs. Sasich and\nLubarsky testified did Dr. Evans further claim that midazolam pro­\nduced CNS depression by binding to GABA receptors and thereby\npreventing GABA itself from binding to those receptors—which is where\nhe went wrong. The Court’s further observation that Dr. Lubarsky also\nused a variant on the word “inhibiting” in his testimony—in saying that\nGABA’s “ ‘inhibition of brain activity is accentuated by midazolam,’ ”\nante, at 25 (quoting App. 232)—is completely nonresponsive. “Inhibit­\ning” is a perfectly good word; the problem here is the manner in which\nDr. Evans used it in a sentence.\n"

GROSS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   These inconsistencies and inaccuracies go to the very\nheart of Dr. Evans’ expert opinion, as they were the key\ncomponents of his professed belief that one can extrapolate\nfrom what is known about midazolam’s effect at low doses\nto conclude that the drug would “paralyz[e] the brain” at\nOklahoma’s planned dose. Id., at 314. All three experts\nrecognized that there had been no scientific testing on the\nuse of this amount of midazolam in conjunction with these\nparticular lethal injection drugs. See ante, at 19; App. 176\n(Lubarsky), 243–244 (Sasich), 327 (Evans). For this rea­\nson, as the Court correctly observes, “extrapolation was\nreasonable.” Ante, at 20. But simply because extrapola­\ntion may be reasonable or even required does not mean\nthat every conceivable method of extrapolation can be\ncredited, or that all estimates stemming from purported\nextrapolation are worthy of belief. Dr. Evans’ view was\nthat because 40 milligrams of midazolam could be used to\ninduce unconsciousness, App. 294, and because more drug\nwill generally produce more effect, a significantly larger\ndose of 500 milligrams would not just induce unconscious­\nness but allow for its maintenance in the face of extremely\npainful stimuli, and ultimately even cause death itself. In\nhis words: “[A]s you increase the dose of midazolam, it’s a\nlinear effect, so you’re going to continue to get an impact\nfrom higher doses of the drug.” Id., at 332. If, however,\nthere is a ceiling with respect to midazolam’s effect on the\nbrain—as petitioners’ experts established there is—then\nsuch simplistic logic is not viable. In this context, more is\nnot necessarily better, and Dr. Evans was plainly wrong to\npresume it would be.\n   If Dr. Evans had any other basis for the “extrapolation”\nthat led him to conclude 500 milligrams of midazolam\nwould “paralyz[e] the brain,” id., at 314, it was even fur­\nther divorced from scientific evidence and logic.

See ante, at 21, n. 5. Moreover, even if this amount of the drug\ncould kill some people in “under an hour,” ante, at 20, n. 4, that would\nnot necessarily mean that the condemned would be insensate during\nthe approximately 10 minutes it takes for the paralytic and potassium\nchloride to do their work.\n"

Bessemer City,\n470 U. S. 564, 574–575 (1985). In other words, this is a\ncase in which the District Court clearly erred. See ibid.\n                               B\n   Setting aside the District Court’s erroneous factual\nfinding that 500 milligrams of midazolam will necessarily\n“paralyze the brain,” the question is whether the Court is\nnevertheless correct to hold that petitioners failed to\ndemonstrate that the use of midazolam poses an “objec­\ntively intolerable risk” of severe pain. See Baze, 553 U. S.,\nat 50 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). I would hold that they made this showing. That is\nbecause, in stark contrast to Dr. Evans, petitioners’ ex­\nperts were able to point to objective evidence indicating\nthat midazolam cannot serve as an effective anesthetic\nthat “render[s] a person insensate to pain caused by the\nsecond and third [lethal injection] drugs.” Ante, at 23.\n   As observed above, these experts cited multiple sources\nsupporting the existence of midazolam’s ceiling effect.\nThat evidence alone provides ample reason to doubt mid­\nazolam’s efficacy. Again, to prevail on their claim, peti­\ntioners need only establish an intolerable risk of pain, not\na certainty. See Baze, 553 U. S., at 50.

The\nCourt insists that petitioners failed to provide “probative\nevidence” as to whether “midazolam’s ceiling effect occurs\nbelow the level of a 500-milligram dose and at a point at\nwhich the drug does not have the effect of rendering a\nperson insensate to pain.” Ante, at 23. It emphasizes that\nDr. Lubarsky was unable to say “at what dose the ceiling\neffect occurs,” and could only estimate that it was\n“ ‘[p]robably after about . . . 40 to 50 milligrams.’ ” Ante, at\n23 (quoting App. 225).\n    But the precise dose at which midazolam reaches its\nceiling effect is irrelevant if there is no dose at which the\ndrug can, in the Court’s words, render a person “insensate\nto pain.” Ante, at 23. On this critical point, Dr. Lubarsky\nwas quite clear.4 He explained that the drug “does not\nwork to produce” a “lack of consciousness as noxious stim­\nuli are applied,” and is “not sufficient to produce a surgical\nplane of anesthesia in human beings.” App. 204. He also\n——————\n  4 Dr. Sasich, as the Court emphasizes, was perhaps more hesitant to\n\nreach definitive conclusions, see ante, at 19–21, and n. 5, 23–24, but the\nstatements highlighted by the Court largely reflect his (truthful)\nobservations that no testing has been done at doses of 500 milligrams,\nand his inability to pinpoint the precise dose at which midazolam's\nceiling effect might be reached. Dr. Sasich did not, as the Court sug­\ngests, claim that midazolam’s ceiling effect would be reached only after\na person became fully insensate to pain. Ante, at 24. What Dr. Sasich\nactually said was: “As the dose increases, the benzodiazepines are\nexpected to produce sedation, amnesia, and finally lack of response to\nstimuli such as pain (unconsciousness).” App. 243. In context, it is\nclear that Dr. Sasich was simply explaining that a drug like midazolam\ncan be used to induce unconsciousness—an issue that was and remains\nundisputed—not that it could render an inmate sufficiently unconscious\nto resist all noxious stimuli. Indeed, it was midazolam’s possible\ninability to serve the latter function that led Dr. Sasich to conclude that\n“it is not an appropriate drug to use when administering a paralytic\nfollowed by potassium chloride.” Id., at 248.\n"

Indeed, the record provides no reason to think\nthat these procedures cause excruciating pain remotely\ncomparable to that produced by the second and third\nlethal injection drugs Oklahoma intends to use.\n   As for more painful procedures, the consensus was also\nclear: Midazolam is not FDA-approved for, and is not used\nas, a sole drug to maintain unconsciousness. See App. 171\n(Lubarsky), 262 (Sasich), 327 (Evans). One might infer\nfrom the fact that midazolam is not used as the sole anes­\nthetic for more serious procedures that it cannot be used\nfor them. But drawing such an inference is unnecessary,\nas petitioners’ experts invoked sources expressly stating\nas much.

The procedural flaws\nthat marred the Lockett execution created the conditions\nfor an unintended (and grotesque) experiment on midazo­\nlam’s efficacy. Due to problems with the IV line, Lockett\nwas not fully paralyzed after the second and third drugs\nwere administered.

Petition­\ners have not been accorded a full hearing on the merits of\ntheir claim. They were granted only an abbreviated evi­\ndentiary proceeding that began less than three months\nafter the State issued its amended execution protocol; they\ndid not even have the opportunity to present rebuttal\nevidence after Dr. Evans testified. They sought a prelimi­\nnary injunction, and thus were not required to prove their\nclaim, but only to show that they were likely to succeed on\nthe merits. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 555 U. S. 7, 20 (2008); Hill v. McDonough,\n547 U. S. 573, 584 (2006).\n  Perhaps the State could prevail after a full hearing,\nthough this would require more than Dr. Evans’ unsup­\nported testimony. At the preliminary injunction stage,\nhowever, petitioners presented compelling evidence sug­\ngesting that midazolam will not work as the State intends.\nThe State, by contrast, offered absolutely no contrary\nevidence worth crediting. Petitioners are thus at the very\nleast likely to prove that, due to midazolam’s inherent\ndeficiencies, there is a constitutionally intolerable risk\nthat they will be awake, yet unable to move, while chemi­\ncals known to cause “excruciating pain” course through\ntheir veins.

The Court first\nconfronted an Eighth Amendment challenge to a method\nof execution in Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.

Eleven years later, in rejecting a challenge to\nthe first proposed use of the electric chair, the Court again\nreiterated that “if the punishment prescribed for an of­\nfense against the laws of the State were manifestly cruel\nand unusual, as burning at the stake, crucifixion, breaking\non the wheel, or the like, it would be the duty of the courts\nto adjudge such penalties to be within the constitutional\nprohibition.” In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 446 (1890).\n    In the more than a century since, the Members of this\nCourt have often had cause to debate the full scope of the\nEighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual\npunishment. See, e.g., Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238\n(1972). But there has been little dispute that it at the\nvery least precludes the imposition of “barbarous physical\npunishments.” Rhodes v.

A method of execu­\ntion that is intolerably painful—even to the point of being\nthe chemical equivalent of burning alive—will, the Court\nholds, be unconstitutional if, and only if, there is a “known\nand available alternative” method of execution. Ante, at\n15. It deems Baze to foreclose any argument to the con­\ntrary. Ante, at 14.\n   Baze held no such thing. In the first place, the Court\ncites only the plurality opinion in Baze as support for its\nknown-and-available-alternative requirement.

And as the Court observes,\nante, at 14, n. 2, the opinion of JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by\nJUSTICE SCALIA, took the broadest position with respect to\nthe degree of intent that state officials must have in\norder to have violated the Eighth Amendment, concluding\nthat only a method of execution deliberately designed\nto inflict pain, and not one simply designed with deliberate\nindifference to the risk of severe pain, would be un­\n"

But this understanding of the Eighth\nAmendment’s intent requirement is unrelated to, and thus\nnot any broader or narrower than, the requirement the\nCourt now divines from Baze. Because the position that a\nplaintiff challenging a method of execution under the\nEighth Amendment must prove the availability of an\nalternative means of execution did not “represent the\nviews of a majority of the Court,” it was not the holding of\nthe Baze Court. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America,\n481 U. S. 69, 81 (1987).\n   In any event, even the Baze plurality opinion provides\nno support for the Court’s proposition. To be sure, that\nopinion contains the following sentence: “[The condemned]\nmust show that the risk is substantial when compared to\nthe known and available alternatives.” 553 U. S., at 61.\nBut the meaning of that key sentence and the limits of the\nrequirement it imposed are made clear by the sentence\ndirectly preceding it: “A stay of execution may not be\ngranted on grounds such as those asserted here unless the\ncondemned prisoner establishes that the State’s lethal\ninjection protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe\npain.” Ibid. (emphasis added). In Baze, the very premise\nof the petitioners’ Eighth Amendment claim was that they\nhad “identified a significant risk of harm [in Kentucky’s\nprotocol] that [could] be eliminated by adopting alterna­\ntive procedures.” Id., at 51. Their basic theory was that\neven if the risk of pain was only, say, 25%, that risk would\nbe objectively intolerable if there was an obvious alterna­\ntive that would reduce the risk to 5%. See Brief for Peti­\ntioners in Baze v. Rees, O. T. 2007, No. 07–5439, p. 29 (“In\nview of the severity of the pain risked and the ease with\nwhich it could be avoided, Petitioners should not have\nbeen required to show a high likelihood that they would\nsuffer such pain . . . ”).

S., at 51; instead,\nto succeed in a challenge of this type, the comparative risk\nmust be “substantial,” id., at 61. Nowhere did the plurality\nsuggest that all challenges to a State’s method of execu­\ntion would require this sort of comparative-risk analysis.\nRecognizing the relevance of available alternatives is not\nat all the same as concluding that their absence precludes\na claimant from showing that a chosen method carries\nobjectively intolerable risks.

In particular, some inmates may suggest the firing\nsquad as an alternative. Since the 1920’s, only Utah has\nutilized this method of execution. See S. Banner, The\nDeath Penalty 203 (2002); Johnson, Double Murderer\nExecuted by Firing Squad in Utah, N. Y. Times, June 19,\n2010, p. A12. But there is evidence to suggest that the\nfiring squad is significantly more reliable than other\nmethods, including lethal injection using the various\ncombinations of drugs thus far developed. See A. Sarat,\nGruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s\nDeath Penalty, App. A, p. 177 (2014) (calculating that\nwhile 7.12% of the 1,054 executions by lethal injection\nbetween 1900 and 2010 were “botched,” none of the 34\nexecutions by firing squad had been). Just as important,\nthere is some reason to think that it is relatively quick and\npainless. See Banner, supra, at 203.\n   Certainly, use of the firing squad could be seen as a\ndevolution to a more primitive era. See Wood v. Ryan, 759\nF. 3d 1076, 1103 (CA9 2014) (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc). That is not to say, of\ncourse, that it would therefore be unconstitutional.

It does\nso by misconstruing and ignoring the record evidence\nregarding the constitutional insufficiency of midazolam as\na sedative in a three-drug lethal injection cocktail, and by\nimposing a wholly unprecedented obligation on the con­\ndemned inmate to identify an available means for his or\nher own execution. The contortions necessary to save this\nparticular lethal injection protocol are not worth the price.\nI dissent.\n"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </code></pre>

                  GLOSSIP ET AL. v. GROSS ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT

      No. 14–7955. Argued April 29, 2015—Decided June 29, 2015
Because capital punishment is constitutional, there must be a constitu-
  tional means of carrying it out. After Oklahoma adopted lethal injec-
  tion as its method of execution, it settled on a three-drug protocol of
  (1) sodium thiopental (a barbiturate) to induce a state of uncon-
  sciousness, (2) a paralytic agent to inhibit all muscular-skeletal
  movements, and (3) potassium chloride to induce cardiac arrest. In
  Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, the Court held that this protocol does not
  violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unu-
  sual punishments. Anti-death-penalty advocates then pressured
  pharmaceutical companies to prevent sodium thiopental (and, later,
  another barbiturate called pentobarbital) from being used in execu-
  tions. Unable to obtain either sodium thiopental or pentobarbital,
  Oklahoma decided to use a 500-milligram dose of midazolam, a seda-
  tive, as the first drug in its three-drug protocol.
     Oklahoma death-row inmates filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 action
  claiming that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment.
  Four of those inmates filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and
  argued that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam will not render them
  unable to feel pain associated with administration of the second and
  third drugs. After a three-day evidentiary hearing, the District Court
  denied the motion. It held that the prisoners failed to identify a
  known and available alternative method of execution that presented
  a substantially less severe risk of pain. It also held that the prison-
  ers failed to establish a likelihood of showing that the use of midazo-
  lam created a demonstrated risk of severe pain. The Tenth Circuit
  affirmed.
Held: Petitioners have failed to establish a likelihood of success on the
 merits of their claim that the use of midazolam violates the Eighth</code></pre>
